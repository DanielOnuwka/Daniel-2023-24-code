// This here is an example of an in-line comment
// I love Mr. Lake's coding class


//below is a multi-line comment
/*the in-line comments are only to be used on one line, but like the other comments, 
they all come up in the same color which is green in  this case
 */

// next we have variables
// in java, variables are represented using 'var', 'let', or 'cont'
// 'var' allows the variable to be used throughout the program
// "let" allows the variable to be used in the scope that is declared
